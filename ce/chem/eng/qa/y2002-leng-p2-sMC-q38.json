Anhydrous calcium choride is neutral and has no reaction with sulphur dioxide gas.\n2. Calcium oxide is a base and it will react with SO~2~ which is acidic. Hence cannot be used as a dryer.\n3.Concentrated sulphuric acid is acidic and has no reaction with SO~2~, Concentrated acid has drying effect (they long for water to dilute themselves)."}
