Let the mass of block X and block Y be Xm and Ym respectively.\nthe specific capacity of block X Xc and Yc respectively\n\n2. By Law of conversation of energy,\nEnergy gained by block Y = Energy loss by block X\n\n$m_{Y}c_{Y}(40-T)=m_{X}c_{X}(40-T)$\n\n$c_{Y}(T=30)=c_{X}(40-T)$\n\n3. Since \n$c_{X} > $c_{Y}$ and so T − 30 < 40 − T\ngives T > 35 degree Celsius."}
