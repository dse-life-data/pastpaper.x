By pV=nRT gives p = (nR/V)T which is a straight line for p (Pa) and T (K).\n2. However, T = 273 + θ\n3. Therefore, pV = nR(θ+273). \np is a straight line with slope = nR/V\nand y-intercept  273*n*R / V\n\n4. Now, the number of gas molecules in the vessel is halved. Therefore, both the slope and y-intercept will decrease."}
